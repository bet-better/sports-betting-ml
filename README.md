## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

Each sport and market type has its own model pipeline. We evaluate multiple algorithms per task (e.g., XGBoost, GLMs, ensemble methods), and dynamically select the best based on live cross-validation and model drift detection.

Our models are trained daily, with features ranging from player stats and matchup context to market movement and bookmaker behavior.
